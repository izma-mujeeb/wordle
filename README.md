DESCRIPTION: <br/> 
Using front-end technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I recreated the famous game, Wordle. Users will have to guess a 5 letter word and after every guess, they will know which letters are in the correct place, not in the word, and are in the word and incorrect place. <br/>
